# PasswordManager:

#### Description:
This is a password manager developed during the spring of 2022 for the project assignment in our **IS Security** course at Uppsala University.

#### How to run the project:
The program works by running the server that will host the encrypted password vault, and performing operations on it using a client application. To store and retrieve passwords, the user must have a master password. This master password is hashed and used in the encryption process. Encryption is done using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) library provided by .NET.

We understand that this project is quite messy and would, since we have learned a lot about practises for writing maintainable code since, do things differently today:)
