# PasswordManager
By **Fredrik Gustafsson**, **Tindra J채rgenstedt** and **Nelly Kv채rnplassen**.

#### Description
This is a password manager developed by myself and two other students for the project assignment in our **IS Security** course at Uppsala University during the spring of 2022.

#### The project
The program works by running the server that will host the encrypted password vault, and performing operations on it using a client application. To store and retrieve passwords, the user must have a master password. This master password is hashed and used in the encryption process. Encryption is done using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) library provided by .NET.

#### Introspection
We recognize this project as quite messy, and would do things differently today as we've learned a lot about practices for writing maintainable code since building this program.
